# casiofont

This package provides support for the [Casio ClassWiz](https://edu.casio.com/forteachers/er/fontsets/index.php) font, available from the Casio web site.  The font itself is *not* included in the distribution.
The package requires compilation with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.

# Installation instructions

 - The package is included in MikTeX and can be installed with the package manager.
 - The package is not included in TeX Live due to licensing restrictions (because the font itself is not redistributable). You must therefore install the package manually into your local texmf directory.
